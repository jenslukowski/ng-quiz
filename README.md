ng-quiz
=======
Learning a new language or framework can be quite daunting. It helps me when I have small tasks which motivate me to explore my chosen field further and in a fun and goal driven way. So in the spirit of the Ruby quiz I introduce ng-quiz, a quiz for learning Angularjs. Every month I post a small task which should be solved in a short time and helps you to learn and deepen your Angularjs and JavaScript skills. It will touch different areas and explores other JavaScript libraries. Two weeks later I will update the post with the solutions.
